# Demo Git Repository

This is the first file in this repo.

## Ipsum Below

So when I started learning Git, I had no idea what it was all about. It was very strange and pretty confusing since I was
new to this entire world of developers. This is what I've chosen to do now. This is my new career path.
This is what I want to be known for. So I'm going to go all out with all I have. I will do what I can
to learn, understand, and master DevOps.
